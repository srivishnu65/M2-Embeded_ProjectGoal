# INTRODUCTION
One of the basic usage of the TIMER peripheral on every microcontroller is to provide the accurate timing mechanism. Using the TIMER peripheral as the basic timing, easily developed a stopwatch and display it to the 8-Digit seven segment numeric LED display. we also used Maxim MAX7219 chip which enable us to interface this 8-Digit seven segment LED display much easier using just three wires of the SPI (serial peripheral interface) to display the hour, minute, second, and hundredth of seconds to the 8-Digit seven segments LED display.
Atmel AVR ATMega328P microcontroller SPI peripheral to communicate with the Maxim MAX7219 chip is used. The AVR ATmega328P SPI peripheral will be configured as a master and Maxim MAX7219 as the SPI device slave.
